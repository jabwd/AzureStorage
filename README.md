# BlobstorageSwift

This package is under development and not ready for any use whatsoever.

## Creating storage configuration
```
let configuration = StoregConfiguration("{CONNECTION_STRING")
```
The connection string used can be found in your Azure Portal for your storage account.
If you are making use of the storage emulator, like [Azurite](https://github.com/Azure/Azurite), you can use the development connection string:`UseDevelopmentStorage=true`
